			<p>
				Hi, my name is Robert, and I am a Unity programmer. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<h3>The Double Precision Maths Library</h3>
		<p>
			My biggest project to date is the <b>Double Precision Maths Library</b>. This is a rewrite of the Unity maths and
			physics types like Vector3 and Matrix4x4, except they are now backed by double precision floating-point numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wrote, from scratch, all of the maths code necessary for a 3D rendering engine. I researched the methods, implemented
			them, and then tested them thoroughly. A uniquely challenging aspect of the development was that I had to mimic the Unity
			libraries as closely as possible. In places, the Unity documentation was lacking in precise definitions and choices as per conventions. In those cases I had to
			conduct my own meticulous and finely detailed investigations. As you can imagine, I became super familiar and learnt a lot about those classes. For example, did you know that 
			in some cases for Unity Quaternions, <code>a==a</code> is <code>false</code>!
		</p>
		<p>
			The library is live on the Unity Asset Store, while its professional-quality documentation lives here.
		</p>
		<h3>Orbit Sandbox (Revival Game Jam)</h3>
		<p>I very recently completed the <b>Orbit Sandbox</b>, which was a submission for the 
		<a href="https://itch.io/jam/revival-jam-2024" target="_blank">Revival Game Jam</a>. The theme was to take something "dead" and revive it. A few years ago, when I began my Unity journey, I coded a
		rudimentary tool to be used alongside Kerbal Space Program. For the jam, I decided to dive back into that codebase
		to revive what lay within using my much improved skills. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I restructured the internal class hierarchy to improve the modularity
		and reduce the cognitive load of the code. I also rewrote some comprehensive test suites to guarantee the correctness
		of the methods, writing 542 tests in the jam's three weeks. Finally, I built new and improved MonoBehaviour components to make it super simple and easy to
		bring the orbital mechanics into a Unity Scene.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, in that time I also had to actually use the code to make
		something interactive too, so I built a small sandbox in which you can play around with an orbiting alien.
		</p>
		<h3>Quick Turret!</h3>
		<p>
			Another noteworthy project of mine is titled <b>Quick Turret</b>. This is a small tower defence prototype, and
			represents my blossoming ability to write simple and effective game systems in a modular manner. I also extensively
			customised the Unity Editor during this project, making the systems really pleasant to use and configure from a designer's
			perspective.
		</p>
		<h3>Project Cipher</h3>
		<p>
			Finally, I have a work-in-progress game called <b>Project Cipher</b> in development. I read an amazing book recently
			called <i>The Codebreakers</i>, and learnt a few things.
			</p>
			<p>
			First of all, it's super feasible for one to learn how to crack
			enciphered messages. Secondly, learning how to do that is quite a fun experience. Finally, there's been some absolutely
			amazing stories in history involving secret messages and people's efforts to crack them. I realised I could capture the
			spirit of this book in a small game, and that's what I've working on.
