			<p>
				Hi, my name is Robert, and I am a Unity programmer. I am yet to get my first professional job in the industry, but would like to start soon.
			</p>

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<h3>The Double Precision Maths Library</h3>
		<p>
			This is a rewrite of the Unity maths and physics types like Vector3 and Matrix4x4, except they are now backed by double precision floating-point numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
			I researched the methods, implemented them, and then tested them thoroughly. A uniquely challenging aspect of the development was that I had to mimic the Unity
			libraries as closely as possible. In places, the Unity documentation was lacking in precise definitions and choices as per conventions. In those cases I had to
			conduct my own meticulous and finely detailed investigations. As you can imagine, I became super familiar and learnt a lot about those classes. For example, did you know that 
			in some cases for Unity Quaternions, <code>a==a</code> is <code>false</code>?
		</p>
		<p>
			The library is live on the Unity Asset Store, while its professional-quality documentation lives here.
		</p>
		<h3>Orbit Sandbox (Revival Game Jam)</h3>
		<p>The Orbit Sandbox was a submission for the 
		<a href="https://itch.io/jam/revival-jam-2024" target="_blank">Revival Game Jam</a>. The theme was to take something "dead" and revive it. A few years ago, when I began my Unity journey, I coded a
		rudimentary tool to be used alongside Kerbal Space Program. For the jam, I decided to dive back into that codebase
		to revive what lay within using my much improved skills. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I restructured the internal class hierarchy to improve the modularity
		and reduce the cognitive load of the code. I also rewrote some comprehensive test suites to guarantee the correctness
		of the methods, writing 542 tests in the jam's three weeks. Finally, I built new and improved MonoBehaviour components to make it simple to
		bring the orbital mechanics into a Unity Scene.
		</p>
		<p>
		Finally I built a small sandbox in which you can play around with an orbiting alien.
		</p>
		<h3>Quick Turret!</h3>
		<p>
			Quick Turret is a small tower defence prototype that I made quite a while ago. While the game is not winning any awards, it does 
			still demonstrate my ability to create Unity games using neat modular pieces. Furthermore, it also demonstrates how adept I am 
			at customising the Unity Editor so that my components and objects are simple for designers to use.
